## Vicharian's Pages
I used the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Vicharian/vicharian.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to edit these pages but likes stackedit.io better

##### Jekyll Themes

This site uses the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme in the [repository settings](https://github.com/Vicharian/vicharian.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
